### Hello! 👋👋👋

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in **[Prof. P. Chen's group at ETH Zurich](https://chen.ethz.ch)**, where I previously earned a PhD in Physical Organic Chemistry.🎓 Before that, I developed Python tools to analyze and support pharmaceutical downstream processes at **Novartis** and modeled complex reaction networks in technological settings during my MSc in Chemical Engineering.🧑‍🔬

I enjoy tackling complex challenges,🤔 especially reconciling theory with experiment, and focus on creating models that capture underlying physics. ⚡ 

🚀 Here, I am starting to share Python tools and scripts from my past and ongoing research journey, and I invite collaboration along the way! 🤝
