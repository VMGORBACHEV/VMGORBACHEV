### Hello 👋

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in **[Prof. P. Chen's group at ETH Zurich](https://chen.ethz.ch)** 🧪, where I previously earned a PhD in Physical Organic Chemistry. Before that, I modeled pharmaceutical downstream workflows at **Novartis** 💊 and technological systems during my MSc in Chemical Engineering 🏭. 

I enjoy tackling complex challenges, especially reconciling theory with experiment 🔬, and focus on creating models that capture underlying physics ⚙️. 

🚀 Here, I am starting to share Python 🐍 tools and scripts from my ongoing research journey and invite collaboration along the way! 🤝
