### Hello! 👋👋👋

I am a Postdoc in **[Prof. P. Chen's group](https://chen.ethz.ch)** at **ETH Zürich**, where I previously earned a PhD in Physical Organic Chemistry. 🎓 

Before that, I developed Python tools to analyze and support pharmaceutical downstream processes at **Novartis** and modeled complex reaction networks in technological settings during my MSc in Chemical Engineering. 🧑‍🔬

I enjoy tackling complex challenges🤔—especially reconciling theory with experiment—and focus on creating models that capture underlying physics. ⚡ 

Here, I am starting to share Python tools and scripts from my ongoing research journey, and I invite collaboration along the way! 🤝
